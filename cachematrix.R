## The purpose of the two functions makeCacheMatrix and cacheSolve
## is to created a cached matrix object that holds the inverse of
## a matrix. This allows for the computation to be done just once
## instead of computing repeatedly as needed.

## This first function creates the matrix object that can cache its inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## This second function computes the inverse of the matrix from makeCacheMatrix

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
